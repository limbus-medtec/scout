# Gene Panels

This page describes gene panels, how they are annotated and how they are used in scout.

## General

Scout is developed to be used in a clinical setting and therefore gene panels is a central concept. The gene panels describes a set of genes with additional information that is often associated with a disease or a disease group.
A case can then be associated with one or several gene panels.

## File format

The gene panel is a semi colon separated text file with a header that describes the columns and one line for each gene entry.

The columns that will be used by scout is the following:

- **hgnc_id** This identifies the gene. *Mandatory*. (integer)
- **hgnc_symbol** This is used for sanity check when humans look at the file. *Optional*. (string)
- **disease_associated_transcripts** ','-separated list of manually curated transcripts. *Optional*. (string)
- **genetic_disease_models** ','-separated list of manually curated inheritance patterns that are followed for a gene. *Optional*. (string)
- **mosaicism** If a gene is known to be associated with mosaicism this is annotated. *Optional*. (string)
- **reduced_penetrance** If a gene is known to have reduced penetrance this is annotated. *Optional*. (string)
- **database_entry_version** The database entry version is a way to track when a a gene was added or modified. *Optional*. (string)

Each gene in a gene panel have to be identified with a hgnc id


###Notes on entries

- **hgnc_id**: This one have to be a valid hgnc id that exists in scout
- **genetic_disease_models** can be anyone in [AR,AD,XR,XD,MT,X,Y]
- **mosaicism** Any entry here will be interpreted as true
- **reduced_penetrance** Any entry here will be interpreted as true
- **database_entry_version** This should refer to a earlier version of the panel
